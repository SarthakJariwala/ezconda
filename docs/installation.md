# Installation

## `conda` (Recommended)

The recommended way to install **EZconda** is using `conda` and in the `base` environment : 

<div class="termy">

```console
$ conda install ezconda -c conda-forge
---> 100%
Successfully installed ezconda
```

</div>

## pip (Alternative)

Alternatively, you can also install **EZconda** using `pip`. However, an existing `conda` installation is required and installation must be performed in the `base` environment.

!!! Warning
    Using `pip` to install `ezconda` is not recommended.

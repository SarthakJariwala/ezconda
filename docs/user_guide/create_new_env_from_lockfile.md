# From lock file

To create an environment from a lock file generated by `EZconda`, you can use the `--file` option with `create` command.

!!! Tip
    You can learn more about lock file in the [overview section](../design_decisions/lockfile.md) and [reproducible environments](../design_decisions/reproducible_environments.md).

By default, **EZconda** will use the environment name specified in the lock file. 

<div class="termy">

```console
$ ezconda create --file sciml-darwin-x86_64.lock

// Creates a new environment named `sciml` from `sciml-darwin-x86_64.lock`
```
</div>

However, you can also provide a name for the new environment using the `-n` or `--name` option.

<div class="termy">

```console
$ ezconda create --name mlproj --file sciml-darwin-x86_64.lock

// Creates a new environment named `mlproj` using `sciml-darwin-x86_64.lock`
```
</div>

!!! Tip
    Lock file are platform specific. Read more [here](../design_decisions/reproducible_environments.md/#platform-specific-lock-files)
